        Welcome to our web application! We are a team of three students from RBK, and we are thrilled to present our senior project. Our application is designed to make life easier for both store owners and their clients.

        With our application, store owners can keep track of their clients' depts and easily update them as needed. This makes it simple to manage store credit, allowing store owners to focus on running their business.

        Clients can also benefit from our application. By creating an account with their preferred store owner, clients can easily check their credit balance and view any transactions made.
        
         This means that they always know where they stand with their credit, making it easier to plan their next purchase.

        We are proud of our web application and the value it provides to both store owners and their clients. We hope that you find it as useful as we do!
